C# / SQL Developer Role Questions

    What are examples of the types of projects you have deployed to Azure?
    -I've deployed numerous web apps in Azure, from basic informational sites to sites that were connected to an SQL database and could alter and update the database. I'm sure I could list more projects if I kept digging but I feel that's the main gist of it.

    How do you classify your senior-ness as a developer? What are your development strengths?
    -I'd consider myself to be slightly above average entry level. I do not have decades of experience that many senior developers do, but I hope to be at that level one day. As for my development strengths, I'd say that would be my current lack of bad habits that are developed through time, as well as my eagerness to learn more, whether its digging through pages upon pages of documentation or reading through forums of people who have had the same issue and what wacky ways they got around them.
    
    Have you ever had a chance to use TDD? Have you found it to be helpful? If so, when does it work best for you?
    -If TDD stands for test-driven development, I have not yet had the opportunity to try out this style of development, but I have heard of it. It's extremely helpful when software needs a specific right answer in some cases, and working from said right answer to the work that creates it.
    
    Can you explain what DevOps and/or continuous integration is, and some of the benefits?
    -Continuous integration happens when smaller merges throughout short periods of time take place and are preferred over heftier pushes. This form of development gets new releases out faster, and new code is also tested faster. In cases where there are bugs, it is much easier and faster to fix and re-merge than it would be with a larger merge.
    
    Are you technology agnostic? Or are you pretty strict when it comes to things like Mac vs Windows, or AWS vs Azure?
    -I'd be lying if I said I was truly unbiased. I prefer Windows, and I prefer Azure. Although, that is mainly due to my familiarity with them both, if necessary I would switch to Mac and/or AWS and learn to be just as proficient.

    After you’ve added the obvious indexes to a table, what tools do you think of using to try to sort out why a query is not running as fast as you think it should?
    -I would double check my query to make sure it is not running through unecessary tables and rows, then try to shorten it further to only necessities it would need to get the results. I would also run the test multiple times to make sure that the issue is continuously happening and not a miniscule server error.

    [ADVANCED] So, SQL “window functions” are pretty much on the advanced side of SQL writing, so don’t freak out if you’ve never heard or used them before. Can you attempt to explain a scenario when window functions can be used to solve a problem?
    -They could come in handy a lot in business sales if the business wants to keep a total of how much money they ar currently expecting overall from their clients.

    How much duress would be needed to pressure you to write a PowerShell script? (I ask because I personally refuse to write in PS, but sometimes it apparently is needed when managing a SQL Server.)
    -I'm a bit unfamiliar with PowerShell but I absolutely wouldn't mind learning and working it into what needs to be done.

    What’s the big idea with NoSQL? When is it a good idea to use that versus a traditional RDBMS?
    -The big idea with NoSQL is that it advertises no relations and therefore: less restrictions. NoSQL databases are more flexible than RDBMS as they can be altered to fit needs at any time during the development process, and they also scale differently than RDBMS do. They're favorable in applications of large data and large traffic, they can scale to meet traffic needs and they pull faster due to the way the save data.

    Have you ever had a chance to use SQLite? What are some of the advantages over SQL Server? Or, maybe when is this a bad idea?
    -I have indeed used SQLite. As the name suggests, it is lighter than SQL Server and much handier in smaller situations, such as a smaller database, or not needing a server. Though, anything with high volume traffic or large databases are not good places for SQLite to be deployed so it makes it a little niche compared to other database options. 
    
    Python has gained a lot of ground due to the surge in data science. But, we are also finding it useful for easier-to-manage admin scripts and ETL processes compared to the horrid affair that is SSIS. Are you now or will you ever have interest in becoming a pythonista?
    -I dislike Python. It feels much too simple to be doing the same things that C++, Java, and C# are doing. Though, I do understand Python and if asked would think about learning more and working with it because despite my dislike for it, it does indeed have its uses.

    What problems does MongoDB solve as compared to SQL Server? If you are building out an API back-end, which of these 2 approaches offers a simpler coding path to interact with the DB?
    -Well, MongoDB is a NoSQL, while SQL Server is relational. I think I would prefer to use SQL Server over MongoDB to link the database to the application.

    Pick from one of these NP-hard questions and give your best-guess response: (A) How do you tell a customer they are wrong without offending them? Or (B) You just went 100 hours over budget ... How do you recover the relationship with your customer (and your boss)?
    -Yikes. I'd have to go with question A. As for my answer, I would ask them to explain their idea fully to me and listen to it, thinking along their logic. I would then try to offer up the right answer as a suggestion, and provide reasons on why it would be better, 'it will make the product run smoother, look sleeker, etc.'. If they turn down my suggestion, I would then try to delicately explain to them that their logic is flawed, pointing out where and how it is, and would ask them an alternative since they do not like the suggestion that I provided until we can come to an agreement on something that is no longer the wrong answer.

    Do you have any interest in being exposed to data science projects? Statistically speaking, 95% of respondents say yes to this question, so if you are going to say yes, maybe tell me what interests you in this topic.
    -Maybe? I'm unsure what 'data science' entails, but it sounds interesting and I wouldn't mind giving it a try at least once!

    How comfortable are you in working on a project that involves touching some CSS and HTML?
    -I'm VERY comfortable with HTML and CSS.
    
    Can you explain GPG, SSL or public/private key encryption?
    -SSL is a security certificate on the internet that keeps data secure on sending and receiving as long as it is enabled. There are other types of encryption such as SHA/HASH which turns data into an unreadable jumbled mess until decrypted.
    
    Have you had the occasion to undergo any training on "secure coding" practices?
    -I have heard of securing coding practices, but have not had any training on it.

    How enthusiastic would you be if we asked to pay you to take some training courses on Udemy?
    -I would be very enthusiastic that the company is taking this much of an interest in me.

    Which of these platforms / languages / concepts / frameworks do you have experience with (so far)?
    - Node SQL Excel Python Windows .NET C# PostgreSQL MySQL SQL Server SQLite MongoDB Azure AWS SQL Window Functions Table Valued Parameters
